Carlos is a software developer based in Cascavel, Brazil, currently working remotely as a Principal Site Reliability Engineer at [TOTVS Labs](https://totvslabs.com/).

While not working on his daily job, he may be hacking on [open source](https://github.com/caarlos0), [reading books](https://goodreads.com/caarlos0), lifting weights or playing some FPS (Battlefield and Call of Duty).

Carlos is interested in programming languages, containers, distributed systems, monitoring and software in general. Feel free to ping me somewhere if you want to chat about any of that. 🙂

He lives with *Carine* (his wife), *Zakk* (a chinchilla) and *Bash* (a Golden Retriever), in [Cascavel - PR, Brazil](https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Cascavel,+State+of+Paraná).
