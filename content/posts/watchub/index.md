[Watchub](http://watchub.pw/) is a service that notifies you of people who followed/unfollowed you and starred/unstarred your repositories.

It runs every day and sends you an email if something changed.

The first commit was about 1 month ago, and I first deployed it to production exactly 1 month ago.

Since then have sent **~200** emails to **~30** users!

I guess this is a good number, considering I didn't promote it a lot (just to some friends and coworkers).

Thank you all, hope you continue enjoying it!
