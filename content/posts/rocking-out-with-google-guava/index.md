According to the [project site on GitHub](https://github.com/google/guava), *The Guava project contains several of Google's core libraries that we rely on in our Java-based projects: collections, caching, primitives support, concurrency libraries, common annotations, string processing, I/O, and so forth.*

I'll show you some cool features that could make you like Guava Libraries even more:

- I'm pretty sure that at least one time in you life you have needed a `Map<Foo, Collection<Bar>>` or something similar, huh? If not, someday you will need it, and when you need, you will see the crap that is doing a lot of checks for a existing collection with some key and creating and adding it if it isn't there.
- [Ordering](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/OrderingExplained) - Basically, a *fluent* comparator class, with a lot of utilities... you will be surprised when you see how cow it is, and will ask yourself *how could I live without it until now?*, you can bet.
- `Objects#equal` - A null safe equals method. Never write `if(foo != null && bar != null && foo.equals(bar))` in your life again. BTW, take a look in all [Object common methods](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CommonObjectUtilitiesExplained) , you can use `Objects#firstNonNull(Object, Object)`, as example, while Elvis operator and Java 8 are not ready :)
- [@Nullable and other utilities](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/UsingAndAvoidingNullExplained) to help you follow the [Null Object Pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern#Java).
- [IO Handling](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/IOExplained), the `Files` class e.g.. Want to read the lines of a text file? Are you opening a BufferedReader? Don't do that:
```java
Collection<String> lines = Files.readLines(mytxtFile, Charsets.UTF8);
```

Simple, uh?

- [Splitters](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/StringsExplained#splitter) and [Joinners](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/StringsExplained#joiner). Suppose that our text filed used in the other example contains a lot of columns divided by a pipe (`|`), now, how can we parse it? Simple! Iterate the collection of string provided by `Files.readLines`, and do something like:
```java
Iterable<String> columns = Splitter
  .on('|')
  .trimResults()
  .omitEmptyStrings()
  .split(line);
```

Pretty easy :)

- [Preconditions](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/PreconditionsExplained) plus a `static import` made your arguments, state and null check easy and clean, throwing the respective exceptions (`IllegalStateException`, `IllegalArgumentException`, `NullPointerException`, etc...).
- [Immutable collections](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/ImmutableCollectionsExplained) types (Immutable Maps, Lists, Sets, etc...).
- [CharMatcher](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/StringsExplained#charmatcher). pretty easy way to match characteres sequences, eg:
```java
String phoneNumber = CharMatcher
  .DIGIT
  .retainFrom("my phone number is 123456789");
CharMatcher
  .inRange('a','z')
  .or(inRange('A','Z'));
```
- There are also [Functional](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/FunctionalExplained) classes, maybe you will want to use them.
- [EventBus](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained). Basically, a better EventListener.
- [Caching](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CachesExplained). Make your app faster.

These are, IMHO, the best features in Guava. But, [there is much more](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki).

If you want to use it in a maven project, just add to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>
	<artifactId>guava</artifactId>
	<version>15.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are not using maven, you can download the last version in [this page](https://github.com/google/guava).

## Cool links

- [A question in stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3759440/the-guava-library-for-java-what-are-its-most-useful-and-or-hidden-features#_=_), talking about some Guava Features;

The project still active, the last release (19) is from Dec 2015.

That's all. Cheers.
