`go build` generates a binary for the platform you run it in. So, if I build [antibody](https://github.com/caarlos0/antibody) in a Linux machine - which uses Mach-O, it will not work in OS X - which uses ELF.

I wanted to distribute [antibody](https://github.com/caarlos0/antibody) at least for Linux and OS X, so I went out searching for how to do this in a not so complicated way...

I found an [article from 2012](http://solovyov.net/en/2012/cross-compiling-go/), demonstrating how to compile Go itself for multiple platforms, so you can use the specific go to build the binary for the specific platform, which is a lot of work to do.

Then, I discovered [gox](https://github.com/mitchellh/gox), which compiles Go for multiple platforms and let you easily compile your application for them. It supports these platforms:

- darwin/386
- darwin/amd64
- linux/386
- linux/amd64
- linux/arm
- freebsd/386
- freebsd/amd64
- openbsd/386
- openbsd/amd64
- windows/386
- windows/amd64
- freebsd/arm
- netbsd/386
- netbsd/amd64
- netbsd/arm
- plan9/386

And it's damn easy to use:

```sh
$ go get github.com/mitchellh/gox
$ gox -build-toolchain
$ gox
```

This will install `gox`, build it's toolchain (all the Go versions) and build your application for them. No further work required!

To automate my work a little, I also created a script within [antibody](https://github.com/caarlos0/antibody), which will build, test, tag and release the binaries in Github using `gox` and [github-release](http://github.com/aktau/github-release). 

You can take a look at the [source](https://github.com/caarlos0/go-releaser/blob/81e3ceb54d321676afcba7d23e9a02a5682ed0f5/release) if you wish.

Hope this helps somebody!

Cheers! üçª
