I wanted to set up a [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) machine for me to monitor random stuff, but I was always postpone that because I didn't want to use SSH port-forwarding, firewalls, create a VPC and/or setup an OpenVPN server or anything like that.

---

I just wanted something simple to maybe authenticate with github and go on.

Looking into some random GitLab wiki (I don't remember which one specifically), I found about [oauth2_proxy](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy), and it seemed like a good idea.

Since this is a simple setup, I used [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) to set up all the environment.

## Idea

The general idea is quite simple:

- all things but nginx listen on `127.0.0.1` only;
- nginx listens on `80` and `proxy_forward`s to [oauth2_proxy](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy) and the other services:
    - `/` forwards to [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/);
    - `/grafana` forwards to [grafana](https://grafana.com/);
    - `/alertmanager` forwards to [alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/);
    - all of the above authenticate using `proxy_forward` and [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)'s `auth_request` directive.

So, let's get this thing started!

## Prometheus

First one is [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) itself:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:9090:9090"
    command:
    - '--web.external-url=http://m.carlosbecker.com/'
    # content hidden for the sake of brevity
```

The important parts are:

- listen on `127.0.0.1:9090` - so it won't be exposed to the world;
- the `web.external-url` with the final URL: this is required for external links to work properly.

## AlertManager

We will also need [alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/) to route the alerts, right? Let's do it:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  # content hidden for the sake of brevity
  alertmanager:
    image: prom/alertmanager
    ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:9093:9093"
    command:
    - '--web.external-url=http://m.carlosbecker.com/alertmanager/'
    # content hidden for the sake of brevity
```

The important parts are:

- listen on `127.0.0.1:9093` - so it won't be exposed to the world;
- the `web.external-url` with the final URL: this is required for external links to work properly.

We also need to add [alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/) to `prometheus.yml`:

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
  - path_prefix: /alertmanager/
    static_configs:
    - targets:
      - alertmanager:9093
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'alertmanager'
    metrics_path: /alertmanager/metrics
    static_configs:
    - targets: ['alertmanager:9093']
```

Note that we change the `path_prefix` in the `alerting` section and also the `metrics_path` in the `scrape_configs` section.

## Grafana

Everyone likes dashboards, and [grafana](https://grafana.com/) is DOPE for doing that. Let's add it as well:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  # content hidden for the sake of brevity
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:5.1.3
    restart: always
    user: "0"
    volumes:
    - /local/path/to/grafana.ini:/etc/grafana/grafana.ini:ro
    ports:
    - "127.0.0.1:3000:3000"
    # content hidden for the sake of brevity
```

Here things get a little more tricky: we also have a `granafa.ini` config file. Here are its contents: 

```perl
; grafana.ini
[server]
protocol = http
domain = m.carlosbecker.com
root_url = %(protocol)s://%(domain)s/grafana/

[users]
allow_sign_up = false
auto_assign_org = true
auto_assign_org_role = Admin

[auth.proxy]
enabled = true
header_name = X-Email
header_property = email
auto_sign_up = true
```

We have a couple of important things to look at here. On the `docker-compose.yml` file:

- listen on `127.0.0.1:3000` - so it won't be exposed to the world;
- mount the `grafana.ini` config file;

And in the `grafana.ini` file:

### In the `server` section:

The `root_url` defines the `/grafana/` suffix in the root.

This is needed because otherwise, even with `proxy_pass` on [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), [grafana](https://grafana.com/) keeps trying to redirect to `/`, as mentioned on the beggining, [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) will leave on `/`. This config file fixes that;

### In the `users` and `auth.proxy` sections:

Those sections tell [grafana](https://grafana.com/) to auto-create an user when someone authenticates through the proxy (using the `X-Email` header) and to give this user the `Admin` role and assing to the organization. It also disables the sign up form.

This way we don't need to login on both [oauth2_proxy](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy) **and** [grafana](https://grafana.com/): You log in within [oauth2_proxy](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy) and everything just works!

## oauth2_proxy

Finally, let's require authentication using [oauth2_proxy](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy). I'm using GitHub for that, so, the first thing I did was to [create a new GitHub app](https://github.com/settings/developers). You can find the details on the [oauth2_proxy README](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy#github-auth-provider).

Once I had the client ID and secret, it was pretty straightforward:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  # content hidden for the sake of brevity
  proxy:
    image: caarlos0/oauth2_proxy
    ports:
    - 127.0.0.1:4180:4180
    command:
    - '-client-id=123'
    - '-client-secret=456'
    - '-provider=github'
    - '-github-org=caarlos0-m'
    - '-email-domain=*'
    - '-cookie-secret=foo bar 1234'
    - '-cookie-secure=false'
    - '-upstream=http://nginx:80'
    - '-http-address=0.0.0.0:4180'
    - '-redirect-url=http://m.carlosbecker.com/oauth2/callback'
    - '-set-xauthrequest=true'
    # content hidden for the sake of brevity
```

The important things here are:

- listen on `127.0.0.1:4180` - so it won't be exposed to the world;
- `upstream` is set to the [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) container;
- `http-address` is set to listen on `0.0.0.0` so we can expose the service to the host (`oauth2_proxy` listens on `127.0.0.1` by default);
- `redirect-url` must be the same as the one informed while creating the GitHub app;
- `client-id`, `client-secret` and `provider` are the GitHub oauth2 settings;
- `github-org` is the required org an user needs to be member of to be allowed in;
- `email-domain` could be an additional email domain filter - for me the org filter is enough;
- `set-xauthrequest` is set to true se we can pass through the user and email headers - grafana uses this header to auto-create an user and log it in;
- `cookie-secure` is set ot false due the lack of https. I'll manage to add [let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) anoother and will create a new post.

## nginx

**Finally**, the last part: [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)!

First, let's create a nginx config file:

```perl
# nginx.conf
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name m.carlosbecker.com;

  location /oauth2/ {
    proxy_pass       http://proxy:4180;
    proxy_set_header Host                    $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP               $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Scheme                $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Auth-Request-Redirect $request_uri;
  }
  location = /oauth2/auth {
    proxy_pass       http://proxy:4180;
    proxy_set_header Host             $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Scheme         $scheme;
    proxy_set_header Content-Length   "";
    proxy_pass_request_body           off;
  }

  location /alertmanager/ {
    auth_request /oauth2/auth;
    error_page 401 = /oauth2/sign_in;

    auth_request_set $user   $upstream_http_x_auth_request_user;
    auth_request_set $email  $upstream_http_x_auth_request_email;
    proxy_set_header X-User  $user;
    proxy_set_header X-Email $email;

    auth_request_set $auth_cookie $upstream_http_set_cookie;
    add_header Set-Cookie $auth_cookie;

    proxy_pass http://alertmanager:9093/alertmanager/;
  }

  location /grafana/ {
    auth_request /oauth2/auth;
    error_page 401 = /oauth2/sign_in;

    auth_request_set $user   $upstream_http_x_auth_request_user;
    auth_request_set $email  $upstream_http_x_auth_request_email;
    proxy_set_header X-User  $user;
    proxy_set_header X-Email $email;

    auth_request_set $auth_cookie $upstream_http_set_cookie;
    add_header Set-Cookie $auth_cookie;

    proxy_pass http://grafana:3000/;
  }

  location / {
    auth_request /oauth2/auth;
    error_page 401 = /oauth2/sign_in;

    auth_request_set $user   $upstream_http_x_auth_request_user;
    auth_request_set $email  $upstream_http_x_auth_request_email;
    proxy_set_header X-User  $user;
    proxy_set_header X-Email $email;

    auth_request_set $auth_cookie $upstream_http_set_cookie;
    add_header Set-Cookie $auth_cookie;

    proxy_pass http://prometheus:9090/;
  }
}
```

Most of it is based on the [oauth2_proxy README examples](https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy#configuring-for-use-with-the-nginx-auth_request-directive).

Now, let's add it to the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  # content hidden for the sake of brevity
  nginx:
    image: nginx
    ports:
    - 80:80
    volumes:
    - /local/path/to/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/m.conf:ro
    # content hidden for the sake of brevity
```

Yeah, this one is pretty simple! Now we finally expose one service - on the port `80`, and we mount our config file to the `/etc/nginx/conf.d` folder. 

[nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) will be the only thing facing the internet for real, and it will route traffic to the right places.

## Closing

So that's it! I'm running this on [http://m.carlosbecker.com](http://m.carlosbecker.com/) - which, given that everything is working as expected, you won't be able to access, and it is working great.

I hope this is useful to you somehow, enjoy!
