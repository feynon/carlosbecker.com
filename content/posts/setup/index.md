Sometimes people ask me what my setup looks like for remote work. I decided to try to keep a list of the hardware I'm currently using. Hope you'll find this useful, somehow.

## How it looks like

{{< img caption="My setup. ðŸ˜Œ" src="446e6162-22a4-446d-b562-834fbd2304ea.png" >}}

I use the MacBook on clamshell mode (closed) because I don't like to manage
multiple screens and my screen is already big enough. ðŸ˜Œ

## Machine

Its a [MacBook Pro](https://amzn.to/2GAaGBm) 15", from 2017.

It has a **3.1 GHz** Intel Core i7, **16 GB** of memory and a **2 TB** SSD disk.

It is more than enough for a couple of years I think, although I want a mac with a M1 chip now. ðŸ˜‚

## Keyboard / Mouse

Mouse is a [Logitech MX Master 3](https://amzn.to/3kMRMJj) and the keyboard is a [Logitech MX Keys](https://amzn.to/3i43b5U).

## Display

[Dell U2718Q](https://amzn.to/3aNRbDb), 27", 4K, IPS - its **awesome**. ðŸ¤©

## Headphones

Currently, I'm using a [Bose QC35 II](https://amzn.to/2S0eYqN). 

It has Active NC and all that. It's pretty good to listen music and work without hearing my wife calling me (don't @ me) or someone knocking.

Before that, I had the AirPods 1st generation, but I accidentally washed them - and now they're dead.

## Others

- Generic Headphone stand
- Generic Laptop stand
- Corsair gaming mouse pad, similar to [this one](https://amzn.to/313Zmqm)
- [Cable Matters USB-C â†’ DisplayPort](https://amzn.to/394xZiG) cable ([see this post about why](https://carlosbecker.dev/posts/macos-4k-display))
- [Webcam Logitech C270](https://amzn.to/2tdcj4O) (I use the mac in clamshell mode)
