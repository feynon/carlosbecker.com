Sometimes people ask me what my setup looks like for remote work. I decided to try to keep a list of the hardware I'm currently using. Hope you'll find this useful, somehow.

## How it looks like

{{< img caption="My setup (very outdated). üòå" src="446e6162-22a4-446d-b562-834fbd2304ea.png" >}}

I use the MacBook on clamshell mode (closed) because I don't like to manage
multiple screens and my screen is already big enough. üòå

## Machines

### Main

It's a [MacBook Pro 14", from 2021](https://amzn.to/3G9mvLh).

It has a M1 Pro processor, **16 GB** of memory and a **512GB** SSD disk.

### Desktop

A AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor, with 64GB of memory, 1TB NVME and a GeForce GT 1030.

I use it mostly as a "remote workstation". I run Docker et al in there, as well as do most of my development on it using the VSCode remotes feature.

### Others

A 2 node Raspberry Pi cluster. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Keyboard / Mouse

Mouse is a [Logitech MX Master 3](https://amzn.to/3kMRMJj) and the keyboard is a [Logitech MX Keys](https://amzn.to/3i43b5U).

## Display

[Dell U2718Q](https://amzn.to/3aNRbDb), 27", 4K, IPS - its **awesome**. ü§©

## Headphones

Currently, I'm using a [Bose QC35 II](https://amzn.to/2S0eYqN). 

It has Active NC and all that. It's pretty good to listen music and work without hearing my wife calling me (don't @ me) or someone knocking.

Before that, I had the AirPods 1st generation, but I accidentally washed them - and now they're dead.

## Others

- Generic Headphone stand
- Generic Laptop stand
- Generic leather pad
- [Cable Matters USB-C ‚Üí DisplayPort](https://amzn.to/394xZiG) cable ([see this post about why](https://carlosbecker.dev/posts/macos-4k-display))
- [Webcam Logitech C920](https://amzn.to/3pqb7DY) (I use the mac in clamshell mode)
