Somedays ago I wrote about [how to build a simple and non intrusive AJAX status with CoffeeScript in RubyOnRails]({{< ref "/posts/building-a-simple-and-non-intrusive-ajax-status-with-coffeescript-in-rubyonrails/index.md" >}}). Ok, I decided to use my spin in more projects, so, I just [gemified it](https://rubygems.org/gems/ajaxspin).

It is really very simple to use and looks nasty =)

You can check the installation steps [here](https://github.com/caarlos0/ajaxspin). Also, fork, comment, suggest, contribute. Be opensource!

Hope you enjoy it. See you soon!
