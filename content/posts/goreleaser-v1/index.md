Hello everyone!

I've been holding on the "v1" release for, *checks notes*, years now. That's because I wanted v1 to have a "stable enough API", i.e. something unlikely to change.

A couple of months ago I realized that we'll probably never reach that, as things keep changing: we add more features, change old ones (sometimes on our own, sometimes due to changes on other tools), and so on. That way, v1 would never happen.

Therefore, after 184 feature releases (and many patches, summing 467 releases) and 3299 commits, **v1.0.0 is finally here**!

This is a special release, since it marks GoReleaser departing from the school of [ZeroVer](https://0ver.org), so I decided to post this compiling the most notable changes.

## Most notable changes

- New `ReleaseURL` template variable which points to the current tag release page on GitHub/Gitlab/Gitea
- Release [Krew Plugin Manifests](https://goreleaser.com/customization/krew/)
- [Announce releases to Linkedin](https://goreleaser.com/customization/announce/linkedin/)
- Support [GitHub-generated release notes](https://goreleaser.com/customization/changelog/)
- Better support for [keyless signing](https://goreleaser.com/customization/sign/) (with `cosign` for example)
- Several [nFPM-related improvements](https://goreleaser.com/customization/nfpm/)
    - "conventional file naming" per target
    - better arch handling
    - `dir` content type
- [Renamed master to main](https://medium.com/idealo-tech-blog/inclusive-language-in-tech-82b19b34b7cf) on both GoReleaser and nFPM
- Some bug fixing (as always)

If it feel like a regular GoReleaser v0.x release, it's because it is. The biggest change here is that we're leaving v0! ðŸ˜…
