So, this is the all-new [UP](http://github.com/caarlos0/up) version. It is more based on my own [blog](https://carlosbecker.com/) in some way, which is a some kind of branch of the theme.

The biggest changes are:

- Assets are now managed by [bower](http://bower.io/);
- Build are now made by [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/);
- `Procfile.dev` is provided to use with `foreman` to watch changes everywhere (assets, pages, posts);
- Removed the hardcoded Jekyll from Gemfile and replaced it with the github pages Gem;
- Bumped all assets versions.

There are also some minor changes, like a new `pygments.less` and other few and small changes.

### Usage

The best way is to read the [project readme](http://github.com/caarlos0/up), but, to get started, after clone the repository and with Ruby, Bundler, Node.js and NPM already in your `PATH`, you can run the init script:

```
$ ./script/init.sh
```

It will install all needed dependencies and build the assets for you (with the `grunt` command).

You can also start it up in watch mode with:

```
$ foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

### Update

To update your previous UP-baked blog, the easiest way is to backup your `_posts` folder and override everything else. If you don't want to do that, you will have to hack around the changes and do it by hand.

Have fun!
